# Ocean Watch Indicators
[Ocean Watch](https://oceanwatchdata.org) provides indicators at the global and country level. Indicators do not require heavy pre-processing like [datasets](../datasets/) and [widgets](../widgets/). For this reason, there are no sub-directories for individual indicators. In some cases, there is information about an indicator in the notebook of the accompanying widget. You can find information on how to create and update indicators in the [wiki](../../../wiki).

## Generating list indicators 
To create an up-to-date list of all the indicators on Ocean Watch, their queries, and other values use the [`get_indicators` script](get_indicators.py).
