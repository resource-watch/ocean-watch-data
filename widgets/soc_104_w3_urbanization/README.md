## Data Source
Data displayed in this widget comes from the [Land Cover Change](../../datasets/soc_104b_land_cover_change/README.md) dataset on Ocean Watch.

## Processing
To create the widget, the Ocean Watch data team drew directly from the [table](https://resourcewatch.carto.com/u/wri-rw/dataset/soc_104b_land_cover_change) for the Land Cover Change dataset stored on Carto. Within the widget configuration, the data was subsetted to transition from any land cover class to urban.
