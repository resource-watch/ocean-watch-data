# Nutrient concentration at river mouths widgets
This file describes the data and processing behind the [Dissolved oxygen concentration at river mouths](https://bit.ly/3oBM2pu), [Nitrate concentration at river mouths](https://bit.ly/3HuKAxO), and [Phosphate concentration at river mouths](https://bit.ly/329fxHC) widgets on [Ocean Watch](https://oceanwatchdata.org)

## Style and Fuction
Three line charts displaying the mean surface concentration of  of nitrate, phosphate, and dissolved oxygen at major rivers outlets into the ocean, over time.

*Click the `i` button on the widgets for [oxygen](https://bit.ly/3oBM2pu), [nitrate](https://bit.ly/3HuKAxO), and [phosphate](https://bit.ly/329fxHC) to read the full description.*

## Data Source
Data displayed in this widget comes from the [Surface Concentration of Nutrients at River Mouths Dataset](../../datasets/ocn_020_alt_chemical_concentrations/README.md) dataset on Ocean Watch.

## Processing
To create the widget, the Ocean Watch data team drew data directly from the [table](https://resourcewatch.carto.com/u/wri-rw/dataset/ocn_020alt_chemical_concentrations) for the dataset stored on Carto.
