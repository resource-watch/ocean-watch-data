### Pre-processing
The Ocean Watch data team used an extensive series of scripts and manual processing to construct this dataset, [as described in detail here](./river-mouths_process-overview.ipynb). In summary, a global set of river mouth points was generated from [MERIT Hydro](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019WR024873) and [HydroRIVERS](https://www.hydrosheds.org/page/hydrorivers). River names were pulled from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). Longitudinal river mouth surface water quality data for these locations (in the form of nutrient concentrations) were then drawn from the [Global Ocean Biogeochemistry Analysis and Forecast (GLOBAL_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_BIO_001_028) product](https://resources.marine.copernicus.eu/?option=com_csw&view=details&product_id=GLOBAL_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_BIO_001_028) of the [Copernicus Marine Service](https://marine.copernicus.eu/) using API calls demonstrated by their [Pretty View](https://view-cmems.mercator-ocean.fr/GLOBAL_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_BIO_001_028) WebGIS tool. The ultimate resulting data were uploaded to [a table on Carto](https://resourcewatch.carto.com/u/wri-rw/dataset/ocn_020alt_chemical_concentrations).
