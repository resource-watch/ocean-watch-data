## Food Insecurity Dataset
This file describes the Food Insecurity dataset on [Ocean Watch](https://www.oceanwatchdata.org)

### Function
Estimate of the percentage of people in the population of a given country or territory who live in households classified as moderately or severely food insecure.
A household is classified as moderately or severely food insecure when at least one adult in the household has reported to have been exposed, at times during the year, to low quality diets and might have been forced to also reduce the quantity of food they would normally eat because of a lack of money or other resources.
