### Download the underlying data

### Pre-processing
The Ocean Watch data team used a [Google Earth Engine script](https://code.earthengine.google.com/1a106a75689826e6bf7283b7d7c7f6f5) to calculate the area of specific types of land cover change transitions across a country/territory polygon set. The resulting data were downloaded as a series of csv's by year. The data team then used a [python script](land-cover-change-structuring.py) to restructure and upload the data to [a table on Carto](https://resourcewatch.carto.com/u/wri-rw/dataset/ocn_calcs_016_land_cover_change_by_territory).
