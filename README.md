## A note on links
When referencing other files in the contents of this repository, we use relative links. If the repository is cloned, these links will point to the local files. When viewing in the github browser, these links must be clicked directly (rather than a right click to open in a new tab).  The relative links seem to fuction consistently in markdown files; however, the relative links in ipython notebooks render unreliably. If a link does not direct you as expected, we suggest you inspect the link and navigate to the appropriate file in the repository content tree.
